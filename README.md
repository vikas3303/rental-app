## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions

- **Frontend Only:** No backend; all data is simulated and persisted using localStorage for easy demo and testing.
- **React Context API:** Used for global state management and to avoid prop drilling.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, consistent, and responsive UI styling.
- **Chart.js (via react-chartjs-2):** For data visualization in dashboard KPIs.
- **Role-based Access:** Only Admin and Staff can access management and analytics features; Customers have limited access.
- **Clean Architecture:** Components are modular, with separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and state.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Limitations

- **No real authentication:** User login is simulated with hardcoded credentials.
- **No backend:** All data is local to the browser; clearing browser data will erase all records.
- **No multi-user support:** Each browser session is isolated.
- **No server-side validation:** All validation is client-side.
- **No email notifications:** All notifications are in-app only.
